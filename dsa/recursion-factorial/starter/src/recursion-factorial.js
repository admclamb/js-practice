 * Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
 *
 * A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
 * For example:
 * - 0! = 1
 * - 1! = 1
 * - 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
 *
 * @param {number} n - A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be calculated.
 * @returns {number} The factorial of the given number.
 * @throws {Error} If the input is not a non-negative integer.
